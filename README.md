# A little insight into Zwanga Muthavhine
Hi Everyone! My name is Zwanga Muthavhine and I am a student. This README will give you a bit of information about me!

## My Career Passions
I really love working in tech. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can help others build something amazing! Whether that's being a manager, or working with customers and relaying that information back to the developers, that is my sweet spot! I enjoy teaching and learning, so any role that enables me to flex my education muscles is the right rol for me, that's why I really enjoy writing and learning.

## My Hobbies
One of my favorite things to do is to watch Sci-Fi movies and Series - even if I can't do those things in life the feeling is magic enough for me ðŸ˜„
